## Info on the USGS gages used for ephemeral stream validations (work done Fall 2022)
There are some inconsistencies in definitions used for the term 'ephemeral' in USGS reports that list ephemeral streamgauges, so we used mean annual hydrographs and google maps to verify whether streams are more likely intermittent than ephemeral and flag them as 'eph/int'. These rivers are still used in the discharge model validation, but not in the 'ephemeral number days flowing' validation. Potential reasons these are intermittent rather than ephemeral:

- Persistent baseflow revealed by the mean annual hydrographs. Usually this goes away in the dry season as the river drys up, but even some of these have a perennial baseflow signal.
- Clear visual signs of persistent near-surface water table (as defined [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-805091-0.00014-1)): riparian zones flush with rooty vegetation, persistent waterlogging, etc. All signs of an intermittently available water table. The hydrographs generally corroborated these visual assessments (small, but persistent, baseflow).
- The saved hydrographs are saved to `cache/check_usgs_eph_hydrographs`.
